# Unified CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a **unified CI/CD pipeline** using **Azure DevOps** for both **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)**. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying my application to **Azure App Service**. Below is an explanation of the different stages within this unified pipeline.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Build and Test (CI)
In this stage, the pipeline automatically builds the application and runs unit tests to ensure code quality.

#### Key Steps:
- **Trigger**: The pipeline is triggered automatically on changes to the `main` branch.
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., using `npm` for JavaScript projects).
  2. **Run Tests**: Execute unit tests using a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
  3. **Publish Test Results**: Store test results for reporting purposes.

#### Example YAML:
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
  - task: UseNode@2
    inputs:
      versionSpec: '14.x'
      addToPath: true

  - script: |
      npm install
      npm test
    displayName: 'Install dependencies and run tests'
    
  - task: PublishTestResults@2
    inputs:
      testResultsFiles: '**/test-*.xml'
      mergeTestResults: true
    displayName: 'Publish test results'
